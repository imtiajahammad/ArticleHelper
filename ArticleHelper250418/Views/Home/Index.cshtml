                    <p>In today’s era, we share our every innovations and implementations with the whole world. It takes us to greater accomplishment to let others know about the advancement that we achieved and also to enhance more. One of the best ways is to publish a research paper. Rather to publish it to a conference. In such conferences, thousands of papers are submitted and also being reviewed. The aim of this project is to make a solution how we can review the submitted papers efficiently. The project proposes a system to mine the papers and bring out the necessary properties to review the papers. It fetches the paper title, keywords and other contents separately such as abstract, introduction, references etc. out of the file. Any paper can also be searched or categorized by their titles or keywords. Both the initial stage on selection of papers and the observation of papers in later stages can be done through this procedure.</p>
